    "message_id": "msg_9e2d7f6a",
    "metadata": {
      "knowledge_sources": ["happiness.definition", "values.contentment"],
      "personality_alignment": 0.95,
      "emotional_tone": "reflective",
      "confidence": 0.92
    }
  }
}

{
  "message": {
    "type": "typing_indicator",
    "conversation_id": "conv_8a7c9e2d",
    "entity_id": "aristotle_ai",
    "status": "typing",
    "timestamp": "2025-03-16T11:30:46Z"
  }
}

{
  "message": {
    "type": "connection_status",
    "status": "connected",
    "server_id": "mcp-hub-01",
    "timestamp": "2025-03-16T11:30:40Z"
  }
}
```

- Implement authentication and authorization
- Create basic conversation and entity endpoints
- Develop initial API documentation

### Phase 2: WebSocket Integration (Weeks 4-5)
- Implement WebSocket protocol design
- Create connection management
- Develop real-time messaging
- Build reconnection handling

### Phase 3: Internal API Development (Weeks 6-7)

- Develop request routing
- Build security for internal endpoints

### Phase 4: Client SDK and Documentation (Weeks 8-10)
- Create Python client SDK
- Implement JavaScript client SDK
- Develop comprehensive documentation
- Build example applications
- Perform integration testing across all APIs

## API Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with short-lived tokens
- Role-based access control for different API capabilities
- Scope-limited tokens for specific operations
- API key management for service accounts

### Data Protection
- TLS encryption for all API communications
- PII data handling with appropriate protections
- Sensitive data masking in logs and monitoring
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Comprehensive logging for security events
- Rate limit breach notifications
- Unusual usage pattern detection
- Geographic access monitoring

## Potential Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

### Scalability
**Challenge**: Handling large numbers of concurrent connections, especially for WebSocket
**Mitigation**: Implement connection pooling, horizontal scaling, and efficient message routing

### Versioning
**Challenge**: Evolving the API without breaking existing clients
**Mitigation**: Implement strict versioning policy with deprecation notices and compatibility layers

### Latency
**Challenge**: Keeping API response times low despite complex backend processing
**Mitigation**: Implement asynchronous processing, caching, and optimized request paths

## Success Criteria
- REST API endpoints operational with <100ms response time (99th percentile)
- WebSocket connections stable for 10,000+ concurrent users
- Successful authentication and authorization for all access patterns
- Comprehensive API documentation with >90% coverage
- Client SDKs successfully implemented for Python and JavaScript
- All security measures validated through penetration testing
