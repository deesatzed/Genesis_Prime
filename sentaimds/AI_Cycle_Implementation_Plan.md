# Genesis Prime ‚Äì Short-Term High-Leverage Implementation Plan (AI-Cycle Format)

> Scale unit: **1 AI-Cycle (AIC) ‚âà 1000 coordinated agent-ticks**  
> ‚Ä¢ On local hardware, an AIC completes in ~5‚Äì7 wall-clock minutes (for reference only).  
> ‚Ä¢ Multiple cycles may execute in parallel shards; the sequence below represents logical ordering, **not** elapsed human time.

| Cycle | Deliverable | Rationale | Key Tasks |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **AIC-0  (System Hardening)** | ‚Ä¢ SQLite fallback logic<br>‚Ä¢ `/health` endpoint | Ensure every agent-cluster boots without external DB. | 1. Add dynamic `database_router` to settings.<br>2. Implement `@app.get("/health")` returning 200 + version.<br>3. Unit-test: boot with missing Postgres ‚Äì expect pass. |
| **AIC-1  (Reward-Vector Engine)** | ‚Ä¢ `reward_vector` (‚ü®R‚Çö, RÍúÄ, R‚Çõ, R‚Çë‚ü©) integrated into Neural-Plasticity | Higher-bandwidth learning signal. | 1. Extend `InteractionResult` schema.<br>2. Modify weight update to `Œîw = Œ£_i Œ±_i¬∑R_i`.<br>3. Persist vector to `learning_history`. |
| **AIC-2  (Signal-Aware Quorum)** | ‚Ä¢ Quorum density tracked per reward channel<br>‚Ä¢ Behaviour trigger on channel deterioration | Links affective feedback to emergent behaviours. | 1. Add `signal_channel` to `SignalMolecule`.<br>2. Update `_check_quorum_thresholds` to inspect per-channel densities.<br>3. Integration-test with synthetic signals. |
| **AIC-3  (KPI Evaluator v0)** | ‚Ä¢ Script `evaluate_kpis.py` + scheduler<br>‚Ä¢ `/consciousness/kpi_history` API | Objective consciousness metrics feed UI & governance. | 1. Mock Œ¶‚Çõ, Œ¶ùöå, Valence-Coherence, Self-Repair, ToM-Acc.<br>2. Write to `kpi_history` (SQLite/Postgres).<br>3. Expose REST endpoint with pagination. |
| **AIC-4  (Frontend Widgets)** | ‚Ä¢ Dashboard components: `PlasticityCard`, `QuorumHeatmap`, `KpiTrend` | Visualises new data for overseers. | 1. `api.ts` hooks `getPlasticityStats`, `getQuorumStatus`, `getKpiHistory`.<br>2. Build components with Tailwind + Recharts.<br>3. Wrap in SWR auto-refresh every 0.2 AIC. |
| **AIC-5  (Risk Guardrails v1)** | ‚Ä¢ Entropy regulariser in plasticity<br>‚Ä¢ Goal-whitelist enforcement | Closes highest-priority safety gaps early. | 1. Compute entropy of reward vector; add bonus term.<br>2. YAML goal whitelist in `ThemisCore`, assert pre-action.<br>3. Canary tests: reject disallowed goal. |

## Success Metrics (evaluate at the end of AIC-5)

Metric | Target
-------|--------
Plasticity avg strength Œî | +15 % vs baseline
Distinct quorum behaviours | ‚â• 2
KPI card fields populated | ‚â• 4 metrics with trendline
Dashboard latency | < 0.1 AIC (95-percentile)
Mode-collapse events | 0

## Execution Notes

1. **Parallelism** ‚Äì Agent shards may run cycles out-of-order; guard via feature flags.
2. **Rollback** ‚Äì Each deliverable must include migration-safe toggles.
3. **Audit hooks** ‚Äì Emit provenance hash per cycle for reproducibility.
