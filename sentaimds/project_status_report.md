## Current Challenges

1. **Memory Graph Fragmentation**
   - Disconnected memories due to forced progression
   - Need to implement relationship tracking between memories

2. **Memory File Size Limitations**
   - Potential scaling issues with large memory collections
   - Need to evaluate database solutions for larger deployments

3. **Cross-Service Dependencies**
   - MCP Hub might depend on memories not yet available
   - Need better synchronization between services

4. **Thousand Questions Integration**
   - Need to create a user-driven approach to answer sample questions through narrative chapters
   - Must develop personality profiling to extract traits from user responses
   - AI module required to consistently answer remaining questions

## Conclusion

The Sentient AI project has made substantial progress in enhancing core components, completing all three phases of the memory system enhancements including the user experience improvements. We've successfully implemented pagination, status indicators, and advanced search capabilities, supported by a comprehensive API layer.

The next phase should focus on implementing the Thousand Questions feature with a user-driven approach where individuals answer 15-50 sample questions through narrative chapters, while an AI module analyzes these responses to build a personality profile and answer the remaining questions consistently.

This approach aligns with our goal of creating a minimal viable product that demonstrates sentient AI simulation while being feasible to implement quickly. By prioritizing the user configuration, narrative integration, and personality profiling components, we can deliver a compelling proof of concept within the projected timeline.
