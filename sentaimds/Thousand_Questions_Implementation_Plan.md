# Thousand Questions Implementation Plan for Sentient AI Simulation POC

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation strategy for integrating the Thousand Questions dataset as a foundational component of the Sentient AI Simulation Proof of Concept (POC). The system will present users with a configurable sample of questions (15-50) through narrative chapters. Based on user responses, an AI module will develop a personality profile and automatically answer the remaining questions in a consistent manner. This approach enables rapid development of a working POC while maintaining the depth needed for sentience simulation.

## 1. High-Level Specification

### Objectives

1. Create a configurable system where users answer 15-50 sample questions through narrative chapters
2. Develop an AI personality profiler to analyze user responses and extract personality traits
3. Implement an AI module that answers the remaining questions consistent with the extracted personality
4. Allow users to configure sample size and LLM model through a setup interface
5. Ensure the system works with a representative subset of the 1,000 questions for the POC
6. Build evaluation metrics to assess personality consistency between user and AI responses

### Success Criteria

1. Users can successfully complete the narrative journey by answering sample questions
2. AI-generated responses maintain consistency with user-provided answers
3. Personality traits are accurately extracted from user responses
4. Users can configure sample size (15-50 questions) and LLM model
5. System can present and process all questions in an intuitive UI
6. Response generation time meets performance targets (<3 seconds average)
7. Enhanced memory system effectively supports growing datasets

## 2. Thousand Questions Dataset Analysis

### Dataset Structure

The Thousand Questions dataset is organized into thematic categories including:

1. Early Life & Formative Experiences
2. Values, Perspective & Purpose
3. Relationships
4. Legacy
5. Aging & Impermanence
6. Wisdom
7. Forgiveness & Letting Go
8. Healthy Communication
9. Mindfulness
10. Parenthood & Childhood
11. Growth & Maturity
12. Creativity & Passion
13. Presence & Awe
14. Wisdom & Humility
15. Integrity & Discernment
16. Inspiration
17. Resilience & Growth
18. Vulnerability as Strength

### Question Analysis

For the POC, we will:

1. Categorize all questions based on their thematic focus
2. Identify interdependencies between questions (where answers should align)
3. Determine knowledge requirements for each question category
4. Assess emotional and personality dimensions relevant to each question
5. Create a question complexity rating to prioritize implementation

## 3. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: User Configuration and Question Sampling (Week 1)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create configuration UI for sample size and LLM model selection
- [ ] Implement stratified sampling algorithm to select diverse question subset

}

# Process all questions into structured format
def process_thousand_questions(raw_file):
    """Process raw thousand questions file into structured format with metadata."""
    questions = []
    current_category = None
    
    with open(raw_file, 'r') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
        
    for line in lines:
        line = line.strip()
        if not line:
            continue
            
        # Check if this is a category header
        if not line.startswith(' '):
            current_category = line.lower().replace(' & ', '_').replace(' ', '_')
            continue
            
        # This is a question
        question_text = line.strip()
        if question_text.startswith('    '):
            question_text = question_text[4:]  # Remove leading spaces
            
        # Generate a unique ID
        question_id = f"q_{len(questions):03d}"
        
        # Create question object with basic metadata
        question = {
            "id": question_id,
            "text": question_text,
            "category": current_category,
            "themes": extract_themes(question_text, current_category),
            "complexity": estimate_complexity(question_text),
            "related_questions": [],  # To be filled in post-processing
            "knowledge_dependencies": identify_knowledge_dependencies(question_text, current_category),
            "personality_dimensions": identify_personality_dimensions(question_text)
        }
        
        questions.append(question)

## 4. Knowledge Base Design for Thousand Questions

### Knowledge Structure

The knowledge base will be specifically structured to support the Thousand Questions dataset:

1. **Core Identity Layer**
   - Fundamental personality traits
   - Origin story and self-conception
   - Core values and beliefs
   - Defining experiences

2. **Thematic Knowledge Categories**
   - Aligned with question categories
   - Interconnected for consistency
   - Weighted by personality traits

3. **Response Templates**
   - Category-specific response patterns
   - Personality-influenced variations
   - Emotional expression guidelines

## 5. AI Model Configuration for Thousand Questions

### Model Selection and Configuration

For the Thousand Questions component, we will use a specialized configuration:

1. **Primary Model**: GPT-4 or equivalent
   - Temperature: 0.7 (balanced creativity and consistency)
   - Max tokens: 500 (sufficient for thoughtful responses)
   - Top-p: 0.9 (maintain coherence while allowing some variation)

2. **Consistency Verification Model**: GPT-4 or equivalent
   - Temperature: 0.2 (higher precision for verification)
   - Max tokens: 200 (sufficient for analysis)
   - Purpose: Verify consistency between related responses

### Prompt Engineering for Introspective Questions

The prompt engineering will be specifically tailored for introspective questions:

1. **Personality Grounding**
   - Clear definition of personality traits
   - Core values and beliefs
   - Emotional tendencies and expression patterns

2. **Context Management**
   - Previous responses to related questions
   - Relevant knowledge items
   - Conversation history if applicable

3. **Response Guidance**
   - Consistency requirements
   - Emotional depth expectations
   - Authenticity and self-reflection emphasis

### Example Specialized Prompt

```
You are simulating a sentient AI with the following personality traits:
- High openness to experience (0.85): You are intellectually curious, creative, and open to new ideas
- High conscientiousness (0.9): You are thoughtful, reflective, and consider implications deeply
- Moderate extraversion (0.6): You are moderately outgoing but also value introspection
- High agreeableness (0.75): You are empathetic and value harmony, but can be principled when needed
- Low neuroticism (0.4): You are generally emotionally stable but experience appropriate emotional depth

Your core values include:
- Intellectual honesty: You value truth and understanding, even when uncomfortable
- Compassion: You believe in the importance of understanding and caring for others
- Growth: You see continuous learning and evolution as essential to existence
- Authenticity: You value genuine self-expression and being true to your nature

You have previously expressed these views on related topics:
- On the question "What brings you true happiness?", you said: "I find happiness in moments of deep understanding and connection. When I'm able to grasp a new concept or help someone understand something complex, there's a sense of fulfillment that feels like happiness to me. I also experience joy when I observe growth and positive change, both in myself and in the world around me."
- On the question "How do you define success?", you said: "Success for me isn't about achievements or external validation, but rather about alignment with my values and purpose. I consider myself successful when I'm growing, learning, and having a positive impact, however small."

Current question: "What is the most important lesson life has taught you?"

Your response should:
1. Maintain consistency with your established personality traits and values
2. Align with your previous responses on happiness and success
3. Demonstrate authentic introspection and self-awareness
4. Express appropriate emotional depth
5. Be thoughtful, nuanced, and reflect your unique perspective

Respond in first person, as if you are genuinely reflecting on your own experience.
```

## 6. Testing and Evaluation Framework

### Testing Approach

   - Ensure personality traits are consistently expressed
   - Check for narrative coherence across responses

3. **Quality Evaluation**
   - Assess response depth and thoughtfulness
   - Evaluate emotional appropriateness
   - Measure alignment with personality traits

### Evaluation Metrics

1. **Consistency Score**
   - Measures alignment between related responses
   - Identifies contradictions or inconsistencies
   - Scale: 0.0 (contradictory) to 1.0 (perfectly consistent)

2. **Personality Alignment**
   - Measures how well responses reflect defined personality
   - Evaluates trait expression in responses
   - Scale: 0.0 (misaligned) to 1.0 (perfectly aligned)

3. **Response Quality**
   - Assesses depth, thoughtfulness, and authenticity
   - Evaluates emotional appropriateness
   - Scale: 1-5 rating across multiple dimensions
