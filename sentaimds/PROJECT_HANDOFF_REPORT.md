## Executive Summary

The Chorus One Sentient AI Web Interface project provides a comprehensive platform for configuring AI personalities, creating simulations, and processing questions through the Thousand Questions dataset. The project has recently been augmented with a plan to integrate the Nested MCP Server Framework, which will significantly enhance the personality configuration and simulation capabilities.

The project is functionally stable, with all core features implemented and working as expected. The current development focus is on preparing for the integration of the Nested MCP Server Framework while maintaining backward compatibility.
