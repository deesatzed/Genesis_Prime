# Emergence Monitoring Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the framework for monitoring, detecting, and analyzing emergent behaviors within the Chorus Initiative. The Nous Core serves as the primary component for emergence monitoring, working alongside other specialized Aspect Cores to identify patterns that exceed the sum of individual core capabilities.

## Monitoring Objectives

1. **Emergence Detection**: Identify behavioral patterns and capabilities that weren't explicitly programmed
2. **Pattern Classification**: Categorize emergent behaviors by type, complexity, and utility
3. **Feedback Amplification**: Enhance beneficial emergent properties through feedback loops
4. **Visualization**: Provide intuitive visualization of emergent patterns and core interactions
5. **Performance Tracking**: Measure system-wide emergence metrics over time

## Implementation Details

To be expanded during Phase 3 implementation.
