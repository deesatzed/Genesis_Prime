# MCP Server Swarm Architecture

*Date: March 16, 2025*

## Overview

The MCP Server Swarm is a distributed system of coordinated MCP instances that work together to provide error resolution and feature implementation guidance for programming applications. The swarm architecture enables horizontal scaling, fault tolerance, and specialized handling of different types of programming problems.

## Core Components

### 1. Swarm Node

Each node in the MCP swarm is a complete MCP instance capable of:
- Processing error resolution requests
- Providing feature implementation guidance
- Storing and retrieving knowledge
- Communicating with other nodes
- Participating in leader election

Nodes can take on different roles:
- **Leader**: Coordinates the swarm, handles node registration, and manages work distribution
- **Worker**: Processes requests and contributes to the knowledge repository
- **Backup**: Maintains a complete copy of the knowledge repository and can take over as leader if needed

### 2. Discovery Service

The discovery service enables nodes to:
- Register themselves with the swarm
- Discover other nodes in the swarm
- Monitor the health of other nodes
- Participate in leader election

### 3. Knowledge Repository

The knowledge repository is a distributed JSON-based storage system that:
- Stores error patterns and solutions
- Maintains feature implementation guides
- Provides metadata-based search capabilities
- Synchronizes across all nodes in the swarm

### 4. Request Router

The request router:
- Distributes incoming requests to appropriate nodes
- Balances load across the swarm
- Routes requests to specialized nodes when appropriate
- Handles failover when nodes become unavailable

### 5. API Gateway

The API gateway provides:
- A unified interface for client applications
- Authentication and rate limiting
- Request validation and normalization
- Response formatting and aggregation

### 6. Personality Server

*   **Purpose:** Provides a unique personality to the AI's responses. This allows the AI to have a distinct tone and style.
*   **Technology:** Built with FastAPI, uses SQLAlchemy (asyncio) as an ORM to interact with a PostgreSQL database.
*   **Key Endpoints:**
    *   `/get_personality`: Retrieves the personality details.
*   **Location:** `personality-server/`
*   **Framework:** FastAPI

### 7. Memory Server

*   **Purpose:** Provides persistent storage for question-response pairs generated by the swarm. This allows the AI to recall past interactions and potentially learn from them.
*   **Technology:** Built with FastAPI, uses SQLAlchemy (asyncio) as an ORM to interact with a PostgreSQL database. It leverages the `pgvector` extension to enable future capabilities for semantic search based on vector embeddings of the questions and/or responses.
*   **Key Endpoints:**
    *   `/store_response`: Accepts question details and the generated response for storage.
    *   `/get_knowledge/{question_id}`: Retrieves stored information based on a question ID (currently exact match, future vector search planned).
*   **Location:** `memory_server/`
*   **Framework:** FastAPI

## Communication Protocols

### Node-to-Node Communication

Nodes communicate with each other using:
- HTTP/REST for discovery and health checks
- WebSockets for real-time updates and leader election
- Bulk HTTP transfers for knowledge synchronization

### Client-to-Swarm Communication

Clients communicate with the swarm through:
- REST API for request submission and response retrieval
- WebSockets for real-time updates and streaming responses

## Swarm Operations

### Node Lifecycle

1. **Initialization**: Node starts up and loads configuration
2. **Discovery**: Node registers with discovery hosts and discovers other nodes
3. **Role Assignment**: Node participates in leader election or accepts worker role
4. **Knowledge Synchronization**: Node synchronizes its knowledge repository
5. **Request Processing**: Node begins processing requests
6. **Monitoring**: Node continuously monitors health of other nodes
7. **Shutdown**: Node gracefully exits the swarm when stopped

### Leader Election

The swarm uses a Raft-based consensus algorithm for leader election:
1. All nodes start in follower state
2. If a follower doesn't hear from a leader, it becomes a candidate
3. Candidates request votes from other nodes
4. A candidate that receives votes from a majority becomes the leader
5. The leader sends heartbeats to maintain authority
6. If a leader fails, a new election is triggered

### Knowledge Synchronization

Knowledge is synchronized across the swarm using:
1. Timestamp-based versioning for each knowledge item
2. Delta-based updates to minimize transfer size
3. Periodic full synchronization for consistency
4. Conflict resolution based on timestamp and node priority

### Request Processing

Requests are processed by:
1. API gateway receiving the request
2. Request router selecting appropriate node(s)
3. Selected node(s) processing the request
4. Results being aggregated if multiple nodes contributed
5. Response being returned to the client
6. **(Optional/Future) Memory Storage:** The MCP Hub sends the question and final response to the Memory Server for persistent storage.
7. **(Optional/Future) Memory Retrieval:** Before processing a new question, the MCP Hub might query the Memory Server for relevant past interactions.

## Scalability and Fault Tolerance

### Horizontal Scaling

The swarm scales horizontally by:
- Adding new nodes to increase processing capacity
- Automatically redistributing work across available nodes
- Specializing nodes for specific types of requests

### Fault Tolerance

The swarm handles failures through:
- Continuous health monitoring of all nodes
- Automatic failover when nodes become unavailable
- Replication of knowledge across multiple nodes
- Leader election to maintain coordination

## Security Considerations

The swarm implements security through:
- Authentication for all API requests
- Encryption of node-to-node communication
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Validation of all inputs to prevent injection attacks

## Monitoring and Management

The swarm provides:
- A dashboard for monitoring swarm health
- Metrics on request volume and processing time
- Logs of all significant events
- Configuration management interface

## Deployment Considerations

The swarm can be deployed:
- On a single machine for development
- Across multiple servers for production
- In containerized environments like Kubernetes
- In cloud environments with auto-scaling
