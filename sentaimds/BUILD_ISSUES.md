# Current Build Issues

- Docker container setup is mostly working but there is a KeyError in the logging system: KeyError: "Attempt to overwrite 'message' in LogRecord"
- All services are starting successfully but service registration is failing
- The next step is to fix the logging error_handling.py module in the shared utils
- Issue likely in error_handling.py or in the service registration payload format
