## Test & Run Procedures

### Pre-requisites:
- Python 3.8+
- Flask and dependencies installed
- MCP Hub service running
- Memory Service running (for distribution phase)

### Setup:
1. Ensure data directories exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /home/o2satz/CascadeProjects/MCP_mem/sentient-ai-poc/narrative-forge/data
   ```

2. Verify configuration in `config.py`:
   - Check that USER_ANSWERS_PATH is configured
   - Check that AI_GENERATED_ANSWERS_PATH is configured
   - Check that COMBINED_QA_DATASET_PATH is configured

### Running the Application:
1. Start the Narrative Journey application:
   ```bash
   cd /home/o2satz/CascadeProjects/MCP_mem/sentient-ai-poc/narrative-forge
   python app.py
   ```

2. Start the MCP Hub (if not already running):
   ```bash
   cd /home/o2satz/CascadeProjects/MCP_mem/sentient-ai-poc/mcp-hub
   python -m api.main
   ```

3. Start the Memory Service (required for distribution):
   ```bash
   cd /home/o2satz/CascadeProjects/MCP_mem/sentient-ai-poc/memory-service
   python server.py
   ```

### Testing Workflow:
1. **Onboarding Phase**:
   - Visit http://localhost:5000/journey
   - Answer at least 5-10 questions
   - Verify answers are stored in `./data/user_answered_questions.json`

2. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Visit http://localhost:5000/admin
   - Confirm onboarding progress is displayed correctly

3. **Knowledge Expansion**:
   - Click "Expand Questions" button on admin dashboard
   - Wait for completion (check activity log)
   - Verify AI-generated answers in `./data/ai_generated_answers.json`

4. **Knowledge Distribution**:
   - Click "Distribute Knowledge" button on admin dashboard
   - Wait for completion (check activity log)
   - Verify combined dataset in `./data/combined_qa_dataset.json`
   - Test MCP Hub API endpoint: `GET /api/qa/retrieve/{question_id}`

5. **SSAI Activation** (if implemented):
   - Click "Activate SSAI" button on admin dashboard
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5000/chat
   - Test SSAI responses with various prompts

### Verification Points:
- Confirm data files exist and contain expected content
- Verify API endpoints return correct information
- Check admin dashboard reports accurate status
- Validate error handling with intentional disruptions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Missing Data Files**:
   - Check data directory permissions
   - Verify file paths in `config.py`
   - Create directories manually if needed

2. **MCP Hub Connection Failures**:
   - Check if MCP Hub is running
   - Verify MCP Hub URL in configuration
   - Test MCP Hub with direct API calls

3. **Incomplete Knowledge Expansion**:
   - Check logs for errors during expansion
   - Verify user answers exist and are properly formatted
   - Check if expansion thread is still running

4. **Distribution Failures**:
   - Verify Memory Service is running
   - Check network connectivity between services
   - Inspect payload format for any validation issues
