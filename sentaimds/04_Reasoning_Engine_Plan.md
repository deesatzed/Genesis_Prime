# Sentient AI Simulation: Reasoning Engine Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the Reasoning Engine component of the Sentient AI Simulation system. The Reasoning Engine creates the illusion of sentient thought processes by managing conversation context, implementing simulated introspection, and generating coherent, contextually appropriate responses to complex questions in the Thousand Questions dataset.

## Core Components

### 1. Context Management System

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Design conversation history data structure with metadata
- [ ] Implement context windowing with configurable depth
- [ ] Develop context summarization for long conversations
- [ ] Create topic tracking and relationship mapping
- [ ] Build context priority weighting for relevant information
- [ ] Implement reference resolution for pronouns and implicit references

#### Technical Specifications
- History Structure: Multi-turn conversation history with metadata per turn
- Window Size: Configurable context window (default: 10 most recent interactions)
- Summarization: Automatic summarization of older context beyond window size
- Topic Tracking: Graph-based relationship tracking between conversation topics
- Priority System: Relevance scoring for context elements based on recency and importance

#### Example Context Structure

      },
      ...

      {"id": "learning", "weight": 0.7, "last_mentioned": "turn_45a8c3d7"},
      ...
    ],
    "edges": [
      {"source": "childhood", "target": "memories", "strength": 0.9},

    ]
  },
  "reference_map": {
    "pronouns": {"it": "learning process", "they": "childhood teachers"},

## Response Strategies for Question Categories

### 1. Value and Philosophy Questions
- **Approach**: Knowledge retrieval with personality-aligned philosophical framework
- **Structure**: Definition → personal perspective → nuanced considerations → conclusion
- **Example**: "How do you define wisdom?" triggers value-based retrieval with personality-appropriate depth

### 2. Personal Experience Questions
- **Approach**: Episodic memory retrieval with emotional coloring
- **Structure**: Narrative arc → emotional reflection → meaning extraction → connection to present
- **Example**: "What is your most treasured childhood memory?" triggers episodic retrieval with emotional significance

### 3. Relationship and Connection Questions
- **Approach**: Value-based retrieval with interpersonal framework application
- **Structure**: General philosophy → personal approach → concrete examples → adaptation considerations
- **Example**: "How do you show love to others?" triggers relationship value retrieval with personality-specific expressions

### 4. Challenge and Growth Questions
- **Approach**: Problem-solving simulation with personality-influenced coping strategies
- **Structure**: Challenge acknowledgment → approach description → growth perspective → adaptation strategies
- **Example**: "How do you cope with failure?" triggers challenge response with appropriate emotional resilience

## Potential Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

### Coherence
**Challenge**: Maintaining logical consistency across complex, multi-turn conversations
**Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive belief tracking and contradiction detection

### Performance
**Challenge**: Keeping response generation within acceptable latency limits for complex reasoning
**Mitigation**: Optimize critical paths, implement caching, and create fallback strategies for timeout scenarios

### Believability
**Challenge**: Creating truly human-like reasoning that appears spontaneous rather than templated
**Mitigation**: Develop diverse templates with randomized components and personality-driven variation

## Success Criteria
- Context-aware responses maintaining coherence across 10+ conversation turns
- Successful response generation for all Thousand Questions categories
- Response latency <500ms for typical questions, <2000ms for complex reasoning
- Convincing introspection simulation in blind evaluation tests
- Consistent personality alignment across reasoning processes
