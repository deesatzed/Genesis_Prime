# Fixed Issues

## MCP Server Build Errors

### Module Import Error
- **Issue**: When running an MCP server build, it would fail with a "No module named 'amm_project'" error.
- **Fix**: 
  - Added direct module copying to the build directory for standalone operation
  - Created a wrapper script (start_server.py) to set up the correct import paths
  - Added proper error handling for missing modules

### Metadata Field Error
- **Issue**: When building an AMM with the MCP server build type, it would fail with a 'metadata' error.
- **Fix**: Added proper handling for the metadata field in:
  - The AMMDesign model now initializes metadata with default empty dictionary
  - The app.py GUI checks for existence of metadata before accessing it 
  - The mcp_server.py template properly handles missing metadata

### Import Errors
- Fixed the import paths in MCP server template to properly import required classes
- Added graceful error handling for import failures

## AMMDesign Model Errors

### ID Field Compatibility
- Added support for both 'id' and 'design_id' fields for backward compatibility
- Created helper methods to consistently access the ID regardless of which field is used

### Optional Fields
- Made metadata and ui_metadata fields optional with default empty dictionaries
- Improved validation to handle missing fields gracefully

## Build Process Improvements

### Self-Contained MCP Server
- Updated build_amm.py to create self-contained MCP server packages
- Added core module files directly to the build directory
- Created a wrapper script for easier startup and configuration
- Added documentation on running MCP servers correctly
- Fixed path resolution for knowledge files

### Standalone Operation
- MCP servers can now run independently without needing the original project structure
- Fixed environment variable handling for better configuration
- Added proper argument parsing for easier command-line use
