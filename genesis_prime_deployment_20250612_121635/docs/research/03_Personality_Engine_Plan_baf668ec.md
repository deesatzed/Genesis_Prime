# Sentient AI Simulation: Personality Engine Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the Personality Engine component of the Sentient AI Simulation system. The Personality Engine is responsible for creating the illusion of sentience through consistent personality traits, emotional responses, and evolving character development, making each AI entity unique in its responses to the Thousand Questions dataset.

## Personality Configuration Workflow

Before processing the Thousand Questions, we need a structured workflow for users to establish the AI's personality traits. This workflow will allow for creating different AI personalities by simply changing the configuration.

### 1. Personality Profile Questionnaire

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Design a comprehensive but accessible questionnaire (15-30 questions)
- [ ] Create scoring rules to map questionnaire answers to personality traits
- [ ] Implement validation to ensure trait completeness and consistency
- [ ] Design default presets for common personality types

#### Technical Specifications
- Questionnaire Format: Web form with multiple choice and slider inputs
- Scoring Algorithm: Weighted mapping between answers and trait dimensions
- Validation: Consistency checks to prevent conflicting trait combinations
- Preset System: 5-10 predefined personality configurations for quick setup

#### Example Questionnaire Items
1. How should the AI respond to ethically ambiguous questions?
   - [ ] Focus on objective analysis of different perspectives
   - [ ] Emphasize established ethical frameworks and principles
   - [ ] Prioritize compassion and harm reduction
   - [ ] Express caution and suggest further reflection

2. How introspective should the AI be about its own nature?
   - [Slider: 0.0-1.0] From "Matter-of-fact acknowledgment of AI status" to "Deep philosophical exploration of consciousness"

3. How should the AI express emotions?
   - [ ] Minimal emotional expression, focus on logical content
   - [ ] Moderate emotions when contextually appropriate
   - [ ] Rich emotional expression integrated with reasoning
   - [ ] Emotionally nuanced responses reflecting complex feelings

### 2. User Configuration Interface

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Build a simple web interface for personality configuration
- [ ] Implement preset selection and customization options
- [ ] Create visualization of the resulting personality profile
- [ ] Build export/import functionality for sharing configurations

#### Technical Specifications
- Interface: React-based component with interactive visualizations
- Storage: Local and server-side profile saving

### 3. Integration with Thousand Questions Processor

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Extend the Thousand Questions Processor to accept personality profiles
