# Sentient AI Simulation: Knowledge Repository Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the Knowledge Repository component of the Sentient AI Simulation system. The Knowledge Repository serves as the foundation for the AI's "memories," beliefs, and responses to the Thousand Questions dataset, storing information in a hierarchical JSON structure with rich metadata.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Schema Design

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Design hierarchical category structure for knowledge organization
- [ ] Create metadata schema for search and retrieval optimization
- [ ] Develop schema validation tools and documentation
- [ ] Implement versioning strategy for knowledge evolution
- [ ] Design cross-referencing mechanism between related knowledge items
- [ ] Create emotional context tagging system

#### Technical Specifications
- Primary Structure: Nested JSON with configurable depth
- Metadata Fields: creation_date, last_accessed, access_count, confidence_score, emotional_tone, source_type
- Validation: JSON Schema with custom validators
- References: UUID-based referencing with bi-directional tracking

#### Example Knowledge Item Structure
```json
{
  "id": "mem_8a7c9e2d",
  "category": "relationships.friendship.definition",
  "content": "I view friendship as a mutual exchange of trust and understanding...",
  "emotional_tone": "warm",
  "metadata": {
    "created": "2025-01-20T14:25:30Z",
    "last_accessed": "2025-03-12T09:15:22Z",
    "access_count": 8,
    "confidence_score": 0.92,
    "related_items": ["mem_3f4a8b7c", "mem_9e2d7f6a"],
    "tags": ["friendship", "trust", "connection", "values"]
  },
  "source": {
    "type": "configured_response",
    "attribution": "initial_configuration",
    "version": "1.0"
  }
}
```

### 2. Storage Implementation

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Implement file-based JSON storage with atomic updates
- [ ] Create in-memory caching layer for frequent access
- [ ] Develop backup and versioning mechanisms
- [ ] Implement compaction and optimization routines
- [ ] Design import/export functionality for knowledge transfer
- [ ] Create monitoring tools for repository health

#### Technical Specifications
- Primary Storage: File-based JSON (one file per major category)
- Caching: In-memory with TTL and LRU eviction
- Concurrency: Reader-writer locks with priority for readers
- Backup: Incremental JSON diffs with timestamp versioning
- Performance Target: Sub-50ms average retrieval time

### 3. Query and Retrieval System

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Implement multi-factor search algorithm (keywords, categories, metadata)
- [ ] Develop relevance scoring based on query context
- [ ] Create faceted search for filtered retrieval
- [ ] Implement fuzzy matching for error tolerance
- [ ] Design context-aware query expansion
- [ ] Build personalized ranking based on AI personality

#### Technical Specifications
- Search Algorithm: Multi-stage filtering with weighted scoring
- Context Weight: 30% of ranking score from conversation context
- Personalization: Query results filtered and ranked by personality preferences
- Performance: Support for complex queries with <100ms response time

### 4. Knowledge Population System

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Develop tools to generate responses for Thousand Questions dataset
- [ ] Create batch import functionality for pre-generated content
- [ ] Implement quality assurance validation
- [ ] Build knowledge consistency verification
- [ ] Design update mechanisms for knowledge refinement
- [ ] Create attribution and provenance tracking

#### Technical Specifications
- Initial Population: Script-based generation for all 1000 questions
- Personality Variants: Generate responses for 5-10 different personality configurations
- Validation: Automated checks for consistency, completeness, and quality
- Update Process: Controlled update workflow with review and verification

## Knowledge Categories for Initial Implementation

### Primary Categories
1. **Early Life & Formative Experiences**
   - Childhood memories
   - Influential figures
   - Formative lessons
   - Regrets and reflections

2. **Values, Perspective & Purpose**
   - Core beliefs
   - Definition of happiness
   - Success philosophy
   - Approach to challenges

3. **Relationships**
   - Understanding of love
   - Family definition
   - Friendship philosophy
   - Partnership approach
   - Conflict management

4. **Growth & Self-Reflection**
   - Accomplishments
   - Personal growth
   - Habits and practices
   - Sources of energy

5. **Challenges & Resilience**
   - Fears and worries
   - Coping mechanisms
   - Failure management
   - Stress handling

6. **Legacy & Meaning**
   - Life purpose
   - Desired impact
   - Memory preferences
   - Value system

### Metadata Tagging Strategy
- Emotional tags: 20+ distinct emotional tones (reflective, joyful, melancholic, etc.)
- Complexity level: Rating from 1-5 indicating philosophical depth
- Confidence score: 0.0-1.0 indicator of "certainty" in response
- Personality alignment: Tags indicating which personality traits most influence this knowledge
- Context tags: Situation types where this knowledge is most relevant

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Schema and Storage (Weeks 1-2)
- Design and implement JSON schema
- Create basic file-based storage
- Implement schema validation
- Develop initial indexing system

### Phase 2: Query and Retrieval (Weeks 3-4)
- Implement basic search functionality
- Create metadata filtering
- Develop relevance scoring
- Build context-aware retrieval

### Phase 3: Knowledge Population (Weeks 5-8)
- Generate responses for question categories
- Implement batch import
- Create consistency verification
- Build update mechanisms

### Phase 4: Optimization (Weeks 9-10)
- Implement caching layers
- Optimize search performance
- Create backup systems
- Perform load testing

## Potential Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

### Scalability
**Challenge**: Managing large knowledge base with rapid retrieval requirements
**Mitigation**: Implement indexing, caching, and sharding strategies

### Consistency
**Challenge**: Maintaining consistent worldview across thousands of knowledge items
**Mitigation**: Implement cross-reference verification and consistency checking tools

### Cold Start
**Challenge**: Generating enough quality content for initial deployment
**Mitigation**: Develop semi-automated generation tools with quality review processes

## Success Criteria
- Sub-100ms average retrieval time for typical queries
- 100% coverage of Thousand Questions dataset
- Consistent responses across related questions
- Successful consistency checks across knowledge base
- Efficient storage with <100MB for complete knowledge base
