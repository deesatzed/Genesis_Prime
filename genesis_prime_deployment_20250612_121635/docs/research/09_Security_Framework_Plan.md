        password: The password to verify
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary with access_token and refresh_token or None if failed
    """
    # Log authentication attempt
    logger.info(f"Authentication attempt for user: {username}")
    
    # Get user from database
    user = user_store.get_by_username(username)
    if not user:
        logger.warning(f"Authentication failed: User not found: {username}")
        return None
    
    # Verify password using Argon2
    if not argon2.verify(password, user.password_hash):
        logger.warning(f"Authentication failed: Invalid password for: {username}")
        # Record failed attempt
        record_failed_attempt(username)
        return None
    
    # Check if MFA is required
    if user.mfa_enabled:
        # Return signal that MFA is needed
        return {"status": "mfa_required", "mfa_token": generate_mfa_token(user.id)}
    
    # Generate tokens
    access_token = generate_access_token(user.id, user.roles)
    refresh_token = generate_refresh_token(user.id)
    
    # Record successful login
    record_successful_login(username)
