## Executive Summary

This integration plan outlines the approach for enhancing the existing Chorus One personality configuration system with the advanced capabilities of the Nested MCP Server Framework. The integration will bring significant improvements including dynamic agent spawning, self-updating memory systems, instruction versioning, learning capabilities, and enhanced security measures.

The implementation will follow a phased approach over approximately 3 months, focusing on incremental enhancements that maintain backward compatibility while adding powerful new features that leverage the modular architecture of the Nested MCP Server Framework.

## Current Architecture Overview

The current Chorus One project implements a personality configuration system with the following components:

- Web interface for creating and configuring AI personalities
- RESTful API for personality profile management
- JSON-based data persistence for profiles and simulations
- Big Five personality model with trait sliders and visualization
- Simulation creation and monitoring capabilities

The system follows a standard Flask-based architecture with separate API, model, and template layers.

## Target Architecture

The enhanced architecture will integrate key components from the Nested MCP Server Framework:
