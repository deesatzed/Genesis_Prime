## SSAI Workflow

The Simulated Sentient AI (SSAI) implementation follows a structured workflow:

1. **Onboarding Phase** - The Narrative Journey application presents users with a curated sample of questions from the larger 1000-question dataset for personalization.

2. **Knowledge Acquisition** - Users provide answers to the sampled questions by progressing through narrative chapters, with Q:A pairs securely stored for future use.

3. **Knowledge Expansion** - A specialized AI process (distinct from the SSAI itself) analyzes the user-provided Q:A pairs to generate human-like responses to the remaining questions in the dataset.

4. **Knowledge Distribution** - All Q:A pairs (both user-provided and AI-generated) are allocated to the appropriate MCP swarm servers based on question categories and content.

5. **SSAI Activation** - The complete MCP swarm uses this distributed knowledge to power the Simulated Sentient AI, which delivers contextually appropriate responses while maintaining personality consistency.
