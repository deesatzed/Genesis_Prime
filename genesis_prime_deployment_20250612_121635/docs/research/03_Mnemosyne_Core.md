# Mnemosyne Core Specification

## Overview

The Mnemosyne Core serves as the memory system within the Chorus Initiative, handling storage and retrieval of vector-based representations, contextual information, and temporal relationships. It provides both short-term and long-term memory capabilities to the system. The core will leverage the doobidoo/mcp-memory-service for enhanced semantic memory and persistent storage capabilities.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Vector-Based Memory Storage**: Store and retrieve semantic vector embeddings using ChromaDB and sentence transformers via mcp-memory-service
2. **Contextual Memory Management**: Maintain conversational and operational context with tag-based retrieval systems
3. **Temporal Relationship Tracking**: Track time-based relationships between memory items using natural language time-based recall (e.g., "last week", "yesterday morning")
4. **Memory Consolidation**: Transform short-term memories into long-term storage with automatic database backups and optimization
5. **Relevance Scoring**: Assess memory items for relevance to current context using semantic search and similarity analysis
6. **Memory Health Management**: Monitor database health, perform duplicate detection and cleanup

## Implementation Details

### Integration with mcp-memory-service

- **Technology Stack**: ChromaDB for vector storage, sentence transformers for embeddings
- **Search Capabilities**: Semantic search, natural language time queries, tag-based filtering, and exact match retrieval
- **System Requirements**: Cross-platform compatibility with hardware-aware optimizations
- **Operational Features**: Automatic database backups, memory optimization tools, and database health monitoring
- **Extension Plans**: Customize and extend the base mcp-memory-service to meet specific MCP Chorus Initiative requirements

### Adaptation Requirements

- Integration with Agno framework for agentic capabilities
- Scaling to handle the full JSON repository of troubleshooting data
- Extension of API endpoints to support programming application requirements
- Enhanced monitoring for integration with Nous metaprocessing

### Implementation Timeline

- Phase 1: Initial integration and testing with existing Mnemosyne Core components
- Phase 2: Adaptation and extension of APIs for Chorus Initiative requirements
- Phase 3: Performance optimization and scaling for production deployment
